DrawBattlefield README

Simple yet fun simulation game based off various ideas over the years. Place various units which will fight and destroy each other.
Unfortunately, funding for expanded RTS features dried up and it was never completed. The code is dated at this point and has not been updated for IOS 5.

There's a lot of raw comments, even more raw code, and annoying large amounts of problems that developed in the last version. 
I believe there's still a crash bug in the physics engine that hadn't been pinned down yet.

Hopefully someone will have a better understanding of how to create games through looking through this.

This code is as is, don't blame me if you use it to run your life support machine and it fails.
